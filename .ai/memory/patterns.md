# Validated Architectural Patterns

This file stores architectural patterns that have been validated and approved for use in this project. All agents MUST consult this file before implementing solutions.

## How to Use

- **Developer Agent**: Check here before implementing. Use existing patterns instead of inventing new ones.
- **Domain Architect**: Validate that changes conform to these patterns.
- **Static Reviewer**: Flag deviations from these patterns as violations.
- **Debt Observer**: Detect when code drifts from these patterns.

## How to Add Patterns

Only the Root Architect may add patterns to this file, backed by an ADR decision.

Format:

```markdown
### Pattern Name
- **ADR**: ADR-XXXX
- **Context**: When to use this pattern
- **Structure**: How it is implemented
- **Example**: Reference implementation location
- **Constraints**: What NOT to do with this pattern
```

## Approved Patterns

_No patterns registered yet. The Root Architect will add patterns here as ADR decisions are made._
